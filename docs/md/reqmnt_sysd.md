## R&D Requirements

External controls: timing, speed, STOP

Serial TTY interface

SPI/CAN/Ethernet/WIFI/BLE

Calibration/tuning interface (e.g. CAN)

## Hardware Requirements

Requires an open circuit board but somewhat ruggedized - thru hole with available test points.

DC power supply connector.

MCU is STM8 Discovery eval board (transition to own STM8 layout)

3 phase bullet connectors.

13.8v DC operation
13.8v DC operation

Resistor divider measurement 3 phases

Available comparator trigger (LM339 or something likethat)

Power LED.

Activity LED on input to each phase bridge driver.

Must meet all 30A ESC category requirements.

Current sense IC

## Software Requirements

Implementation on STM8s MCU
STVD/Cosmic (potentially to sdcc)
