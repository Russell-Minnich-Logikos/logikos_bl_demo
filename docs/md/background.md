## Background Task Operations {#background}

The background task deals with the UI and the communication stack so its exact
timing can't be known but worst case must not exceed some portion of the system
frame time (TIM4 period).

### Throttle Input Handler

The analog slider and digital trim switch are for developement use only. The normal
throttle control use case is the standard RC radio servo proportional signal.

Spektrum and other newer receivers have a friendly voice warning if throttle high.
However, the ESC should still do its own detection.
